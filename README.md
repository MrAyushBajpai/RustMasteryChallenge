# RustMasteryChallenge
This repository is dedicated to a personal coding challenge: building projects entirely from Rust's official documentation. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of the language, its core concepts, and ecosystem by relying solely on reference materials, rather than external tutorials or guides.
