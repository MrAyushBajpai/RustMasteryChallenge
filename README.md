# Rust Documentation Challenge
### Overview

This repository is dedicated to a personal coding challenge: building projects **entirely from Rust's official documentation**. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of the language, its core concepts, and ecosystem by **relying solely on reference materials, rather than external tutorials or guides**.

The challenge emphasizes Problem-solving through documentation-driven learning

### Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to:
- Push the boundaries of self-guided learning
- Improve my ability to read and interpret technical documentation
- Gain confidence in building real-world Rust applications without external code examples
- Develop a strong, intuitive grasp of Rust’s design patterns and best practices

### Rules
- No tutorials, blogs, AI Tools or forums – only Rust's official documentation, books, and reference materials are allowed.
- No copy-pasting from external sources.
- Focus on understanding every line of code written.
- Document learning and take notes for future reference.

### Motivation

This challenge is about **pushing my personal boundaries** and **relying less on AI or external shortcuts**, with the goal of **improving my problem-solving skills, self-reliance, and ability to learn independently**. The focus is on personal growth, not just mastering Rust.
